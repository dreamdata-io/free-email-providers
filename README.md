To do this we use many different data sources, one is this free email providers list. The list help us understand if a person who signed up are using a free email provider or not. The list will also contains comon mispellings of free email domains such as gmai.com etc. or domains commonly used for test purpose such as test.com and example.org.

To the best of our abilities we will try to keep this list updated. However feel free to add those you think are missing.
